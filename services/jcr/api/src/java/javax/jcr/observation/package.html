<body>
Provides interfaces and classes for the event observation functionality of a level
2 Java Content Repository. A level 1 implementation of the JCR is not required
to implement the interfaces in this package. Observvation support is optional
in level 2, therefore a level 2 implementation <b>may</b>
implement the interfaces in this package.

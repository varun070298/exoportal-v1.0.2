      <p>The eXo Platform is an open source <b>integrated application suite</b> providing 
      commonly needed services, components and modules to programmers when building web based 
      information portals.</p>

      <p>A portal's purpose is mostly to consolidate access to information and integrating 
      dispersed functionality, for example, within a company. We define a portal as a 
      <i>gateway to several dynamic information sources</i>. A consolidated portal page is 
      composed of one or more portlets which serve as independent views of information or 
      give access to various types of functionality. Portlets are written and customized 
      for your specific environment by programmers to i.e. enable centralized access to news 
      articles from various corporate departments.</p>

      <p>Currently, a key feature of the eXo Platform is <b>its portlet container's certified 
        compliance</b> with the JSR 168 portlet API specification from Sun Microsystems. A portlet 
      container is a server service which enables portlets to exchange information and access 
      services such as user authentication or persistent information storage. The specification 
      allows portlets to be interchangeable between portal servers as long as the portal server 
      conforms to the specification.</p>

      <p><b>The business value</b> of implementing an eXo Platform based portal sytems from 
      the infrastructure and many services already provided by the server. Reusing and 
      customizing existing services and internal infrastructure increases speed to market, ROI 
      and prevents duplicate efforts by the development team.</p>

      <p>Two editions of the eXo Platform exist: <i>express</i> and <i>enterprise</i>. The express
      edition is intended for small to medium sized organizations without sophisticated information
      and integration needs while the Enterprise edition requires a Java application server and 
      thus enables much more robust and extended functionality. Both versions are distributed 
      under several licensing models all of which include the source code.</p>

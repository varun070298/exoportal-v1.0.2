      <img style="float: left" src="/portal/images/blogs.gif"/>Blogs are a new fancy way
      for people to communicate and share ideas over the internet. Over the past 2 years 
      the number of blogs have dramatically increased and its spreading probably helped 
      eXo platform to have the success it has today. We have computed a list of the blogs 
      that dealt with the eXo platform, if you know others feel free to mail us at 
      <a href="mailto:blogs@exoplatform.com">blogs@exoplatform.com</a>

      <p>We would like to start with <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/portlets">Punit Pandey's Weblog on Portlets</a>.
      This blogs contains valuable information on portlets (portlet API, WSRP and portals in 
      general). Punit has also created two Yahoo groups :</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/portlets/" class="rBookmark0"
          title="" >Portlet Discussion Group</a><br /></li>
        <li><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wsrp/" class="rBookmark0"
          title="" >WSRP Discussion Group</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Carlos Perez's weblog - called <a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/open_source_portal_servers_in_java/view">Manageability</a>
      - is also full of precious information including quite a big list of Open Source portals. 
      A poll <a href="http://www.manageability.org/polls/what-is-the-best-open-source-portal-server">
        "what is the best open source portal server"</a> is also available.</p>
      
      <p>Our portal is based on Java Server Faces that is the web framework new standard. For 
      information on web components and products available have a look at 
      <a href="http://www.jsfcentral.com/products/">JSF Central</a>.
      <a href="http://www.jamesholmes.com/JavaServerFaces/">James Holmes' site</a> is also 
      interesting for JSF beginners.  Finally, have a look at Kito Mann TSS 
      <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/talks/videos/KitoMannText/interview.tss">interview</a> 
      on Java Server Faces.</p>

      <p>Our software comes with an eclipse plugin. For more plugins have a look at the
      <a href="http://www.eclipse-plugins.info/eclipse/plugin_details.jsp?id=624">eclipse plugin 
        repository</a>.</p>

      <p>Each time we announced news, articles or released we created a thread on The Server 
      Side site. Many comments and questions where asked there, so it may interest you :</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=24589">eXo platform 1.0 updated</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.theserverside.com/discussions/thread.tss?thread_id=23760">eXo platform SARL's Open letter to Vignette corporation</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=21461">TSS Article: Introducing the eXo Platform</a></li>

      </ul>

      <p>Here is an interesting <a href="http://www.east.asu.edu/ctas/dcst/Projects/May2004/SreeBoddapati.pdf">
        research paper</a> that uses eXo platform for its JSR 168 tests. This other
      <a href="http://www.tic.udc.es/~fbellas/publications/ic-march-april-2004.pdf">research paper</a>
      is getting deeper into the WSRP specification.</p>

      <p><a href="http://web.princeton.edu/sites/isapps/jasig/2003winterMiami/presentations/SangShinportlet.pdf">
        Here</a> is a presentation about JSR 168 given by a Sun evangelist. Well the end is more 
      Sun marketing but it has a slide about eXo platform and its JSF capabilities.</p>

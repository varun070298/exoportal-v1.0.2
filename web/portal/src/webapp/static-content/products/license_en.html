      <p>The <b>eXo platform&#153;</b> uses the GPL license. In sum, that means the platform 
      is free for any GPL user. The exact terms of the GPL license can be found at the 
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Fundation</a> web site.</p>
      <p>The <b>eXo platform&#153;</b> is also available under a commercial non-GPL license. 
      If you purchase the beta versions under the commercial license, this is automatically 
      valid for the final corresponding version.</p>

      <p>In both cases, the source code is available.</p>

      <p><b>All our products are free of charge in the following cases</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Your application is under the GPL license.</b> In this case, you are free to 
        ship our products with your application without any additional written agreement with us. 
        We welcome you, however, to stay in touch for marketing and partnership opportunities.</li>

        <li><b>You never copy, modify or distribute.</b> If you never copy, modify or distribute 
        the <b>eXo platform&#153;</b> products, you are free to use them, whatever your license. 
        But, be careful:
          <ul>
            <li><u>Modifying and distributing.</u> You are free to modify the <b>eXo platform&#153;</b>
            as you please. However, if you distribute the modified version, all changes, all 
            interface code and all code connecting directly or indirectly to the latter fall under 
            the GPL license.
            </li>
            <li><u>Copying.</u> You are allowed to copy the <b>eXo platform&#153;</b> binaries 
            and source code, but the copies will automatically fall under the GPL license.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p><b>In all other cases you must purchase the commercial non-GPL license.</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your application is non licensed under the GPL license and you intend to distribute the
        <b>eXo platform&#153;</b> internally or externally.</li>
        <li>You use the <b>eXo platform&#153;</b> within your organisation and do not want to 
        risk it falling under the GPL license.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>These rules apply even if you ship a free demo version of your application with the 
      eXo platform&#153;.</p>

      <p><b>Reasons to choose the commercial license, anyway:</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Under the commercial license the eXo platform SARL takes responsability for its 
        products, whereas there are no warranties or representations from the developer under 
        the GPL license.</li>
        <li>If you have any doubt about the licensing issues, we recommend that you use the 
        commercial license.  This may save you a lot of trouble, and you are never wrong. Besides, 
        the prices for our products are way below the industry average.</li>

      <p>The <b>eXo platform&#153; <i>express</i></b> edition has been created to be used with a 
      simple Java web server - servlet container - such as 
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>. This solution is perfect for a 
      small to medium load charge site.  A large selection of portlets is available for 
      distribution, the most important presented below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Core portlets. </b> The selection includes all the administration portlets 
        such as registration, login/logout, monitors and layout customization, as well as 
        the edit portlet. The latter allows the identified users to create portlets' 
        contents via a "What You See Is What You Get" HTML editor (WYSIWYG). The created 
        document is saved in the CMS directory.</li>

        <li><b>Technology wrappers portlets.</b> One of the big advantages of the portlet API 
        is the opportunity to use several technologies within the portlets, even if the portal 
        itself is built upon some other technology. Thus, we provide specific portlets such as 
        Velocity, Struts, Cocoon or a Java Server faces portlet. There is also an IFrame portlet 
        that allows the introduction of another web application in the portal, making it 
        possible to use PHP, ASP or CGI applications in Java portlets.</li>
        
        <li><b>Out of the box portlet. </b> Many ready to use portlets can be bundled with the 
        eXo platform&#153; express edition - synchroneous and asynchroneous communication tools 
        (chat, forum, e-mail), calendar and rss (content syndication). </li>
      </ul>

      <b>eXo platform&#153; <i>express</i> </b>version ideally suites an individual, or a 
      small to medium-sized enterprise that needs an efficient low-cost portal solution to

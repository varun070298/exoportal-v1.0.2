      <p>The implementation process is based on the ULM diagrams developed during the design phase. 
      For each client, the following developments are to be made in order to build the personalised
      solution:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The server parametrisation in order to meet with the security policy of the client</li>
        <li>Development of the access to the organisation model of the client company (LDAP, SGBD)</li>
        <li>Connectors development using JCA</li>
        <li>Implementation of the portlets to access third party applications using the eXo 
        platform&#153; portlet development framework</li>
        <li>XML representation of the modelled business processes</li>
        <li>Build of unit tests based on use cases defined in the design phase, according to 
        software industries best practises and XP programmation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Finally the <b>eXo platform SARL</b> performs the load stress tests before putting 
      the portal into production.</p>

      <p>The purpose of the audit is to establish a complete diagnosis of a company's 
      inefficiencies and needs so as to design and assemble the best portal solution possible. 
      To perform this study, the <b>eXo platform SARL</b> analyses your information system, 
      and searches for problems in critical information distribution and the organisation of 
      business processes. Furthemore, the employees' behaviour is analysed to determine potential 
      adaptation problems.</p>

      <p><b>Information system analysis.</b> The audit carries out an inventory of all 
      applications defining the use level of each application and existing redunduncies among 
      them.</p>

      <p><b> Distribution of critical information. </b> An important part of the diagnosis is to 
      define the contents necessary for decision making and/or relative to the company's business, 
      as well as the optimal display of this information.</p>

      <p><b>Unproductive business processes. </b> Analysis of management and business 
      processes to uncover inefficiencies and define reengineering to be performed.</p>

      <p><b>Agents behaviour survey.</b> Surveys and interviews are used to qualify and quantify
      employees' fears and intimidations confronting an innovative software. The results are used 
      for the selection of products and also for adapting the training program to employees' 
      needs.</p>

      <p>The choice of portal solution is not purely a matter of technology - the human factor 
      being essential. Consequently, beyond technical skills the audit is based on management 
      and comportamental survey methods, as used in management sciences and sociology.</p>

      <p>The <b>eXo platform SARL</b> can perform any additional developments suiting your 
      specific requirements, whether you have used our set of services to introduce the eXo 
      platform&#153; into your company or not.  We offer two types of custom development:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>The on-line custom development.</b> Representing the developers' knowledge of 
        the platform, we can execute some developments without sending our team on-site. 
        At all stages of the development - from the detailed requirements specification to 
        the final integration - we collaborate with your team via synchronous and asynchronous 
        communication tools on the platform.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><b> The on-site custom development.</b> This mode is generally used for more value 
        added developments where we send a team of <b>eXo platform&#153;</b> certified consultants 
        to work on-site. In this case, the consultants also collaborate with your technical team 
        through all devlopment stages, but your team contributions and responsabilities are of 
        less importance.</li>

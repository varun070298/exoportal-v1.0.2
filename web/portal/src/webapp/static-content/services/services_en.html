      <p>The <b>eXo platform SARL</b> offers several types of consultancy services leading your 
      company through all the stages of establishing a corporate portal. First we analyse your 
      information system, defining and specifying with you all your needs and requirements. 
      Based on the results we perform the project design and architecture supervision. We then 
      guide your selection from our product offerings, and from those of the open source 
      community, defining a solution that best suits you.  Finally, we integrate the chosen 
      solution into your system and provide efficient training for all your employees.</p>

      <p>The <b>eXo platform SARL</b> offers two types of support:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The on-line support.</b> The on-line support is there to help you deal with any 
        technical issues arising after the introduction of the portal. This service is based on 
        the set of synchronous and asynchronous tools provided with the eXo platform&#153;. 
        Your technical team may pose any question, by e-mail or on the private forum, and we 
        answer you under specified deadlines. To treat more serious issues, a chat appointement 
        with our consultant can be fixed. We try to ensure that you always communicate with the 
        same consultant, to offer you the most efficient support possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The on-site support.</b> We also provide on-site support sending out the 
        relevant <b>eXo platform&#153;</b> certified consultants to resolve your technical 
        problems and integration issues together with your team.</li>
      </ul>

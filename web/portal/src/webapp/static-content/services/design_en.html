      <p>The <b>eXo platform SARL</b> offers both hardware and software architecture services.</p>
      <p><b>Hardware architecture supervision.</b> Of course, this service is not mandatory but 
      can be provided on demand. It deals with the following issues:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Computer choice.</b> If extra machine power is needed to run the software, the eXo

        <li><b>Network organisation.</b> We determine the best network architecture for your 
        requirements between the 3-tiers and the 4-tiers solutions.</li>
        <li><b>Failover. </b>Failover and backup management has to be insured in order to 
        garantee the safety of your work processes in case of technical failures.</li>
        <li><b>Scalability.</b> The system has to offer the same time and quality of execution 
        whatever the number of users connected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Software architecture supervision. </b> This service designs the corporate portal 
      based on the audit results and adapted to the client requirements.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>J2EE server. </b>We can prospect the market on your behalf and help you decide 
        between different commercial and open source offers of J2EE specified servers.</li>
        <li><b>eXo platform&#153; version.</b> The choice between the Express version and the 
        Enterprise version is made based on the client's needs for EJB and workflow.</li>
        <li><b>Core parts. </b>The company chooses the core parts of the eXo platform&#153; that
        the portal will be built upon.</li>
        <li><b>Portlets.</b> According to the audit results, we determine the list of the 
        generic portlets to use.</li>
        <li><b>Third party applications.</b> The eXo platform SARL determines the list of 
        third party applications needed or already existing in the client's system and 
        figures out the means of their integration into the portal via connectors.</li>
        <li><b>Business processes conception.</b> We model the business processes defined by 
        the audit. Each process is divided in several activities, one unit representing a 
        coherent operational task.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Output.</b> The previous work stages lead to the conception of the UML diagrams 
      necessary for the portal build-up.</p>

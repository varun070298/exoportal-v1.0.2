      <p>The <b>eXo platform SARL</b> offers two types of training - the e-learning program and 
      the on-site program - as a package or as separate components.</p>
      
      <p>The on-line e-learning is based on the use of the communication tools provided with the 
      eXo platform.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>The on-line training.</b> Thanks to the platform's synchronous and asynchronous 
        tools the employees/users communicate directly with the teacher.</li>
        <li><b>Interactive programs.</b> We are also developing a set of video clips and 
        interactive programs to be used by employees and the company's Extranet users for 
        training purposes. These tools complete the default help tools provided with the platform.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In addition to our e-learning services, we provide on-site education and training 
      performed by an eXo platform certified consultant. This program is organised as a set of 
      class courses over one or two weeks.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Basic course.</b> The basic training course covers how to use the different tools 
        and help portlets.</li>
        <li><b>Advanced course. </b> The advanced training course covers personalising of 
        the user's platform layout and contents, of the business processes related to the user's 
        work, and integration of third party applications into the platform.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With these extensive training services the <b>eXo platform SARL</b> provides flexible 
      professional accompaniment in your employees' adaptation.</p>

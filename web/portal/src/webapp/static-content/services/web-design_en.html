      <p>The web site design is essential for a good corporate portal. It must adhere to 
      the company's graphic charter, and most important, it must reflect the corporate values.  
      This way every user - whether an employee or a client - can identify with these 
      values and abide by them.  Therefore, the <b>eXo platform SARL</b> provides a professional 
      web design service based on the <b> eXo platform&#153; </b> performed in two successive 
      stages: 

      <p><b>Design build-up.</b> First the target colours are determined, reflecting the company's 
      cultural environment -  nationality, business sector, etc. The company's graphic charter is 
      then used to define the site's general layout and appearance. This work is based on 
      marketing studies and is performed in colaboration with the company's marketing division.</p>

      <p><b>Development.</b> Based on the graphic charter and policies established during the 
      first stage our design team carries out further necessary developments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Color.</b> The colors are defined according to the client's requirements.</li>
        <li><b>Portlets design.</b>The portlets' colors, layout and overall design are adapted 
        to the graphic charter.</li>
        <li><b>Banner, footer and columns design.</b> The banner, footer or columns can be 
        deleted from some of the pages. Their size, colour and graphic elements are adapted to 
        the specified requirements.</li>
        <li><b>Buttons and icons.</b> Special buttons and icons are designed or selected from 
        the catalogue.</li>
      </ul>

      our extensive knowledge of the <b> eXo platform&#153; </b>, we provide a fast and reliable 
      web design service up to the highest professional standards, for a price way below the

<table>  <tr>    <td style="text-align: justify">      <img style="float:right" src="/portal/images/image5.gif"/> All companies today      produce volumes of documents. When individual employees file work on their own       computers it is difficult to know if required information is available or not,      and where. Finding old information on one computer can be cumbersome enough - with       several people employed the task soon becomes overwhelming, representing a waste       of time and money.       <p> A content management system (CMS) provides an efficient solution to       this problem, based on the following features: </p>      <ul>        <li> <b> Easy and unified access. </b> All documents are saved in a           unique directory under project sub-directories and are accessible           from distance. This means specifically, that an employee is able to           edit his company filed document with his laptop or pda from home or           when travelling. </li>        <li> <b> Security management. </b> The system will provide powerful           security management enabling control and easy access for the           authorized individuals. </li>        <li> <b> Version management. </b> With this feature several individuals           can edit the same document simultaneously, and the system will save           the changes under different version numbers. </li>        <li> <b> Publishing Workflow management. </b> Finally, a CMS should           offer publishing workflow facilities. For example, for a document           that must be viewed and approved by several individuals the system           integrates and manages this workflow information sending automatic           requests to the people concerned and validating their references.           </li>      </ul>      <img style="float: left" src="/portal/images/image6.gif"/> The <b> eXo platform&#153;      </b> aims at offering an integrated solution of corporate portal and content management       system facilities.  Indeed, the eXo platform team believes that, if both of       these features are essential to a better organisation of work processes in the      client company, the integrated solution is more than the sum of its parts.            <p> From a technical point of view, an integrated solution is easier to install       and to manage. Thanks to the integration additional flexibility can be achieved       in both features, with each part benefiting from the other. </p>      <p> From a business point of view, an integrated solution is cheaper for the       client, who also benefits from having a single provider and support group. </p>    </td>  </tr></table>

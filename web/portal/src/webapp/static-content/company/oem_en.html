      <p><b>SCORE Adaptive Bridges</b> from Delta Software Technology GmbH is the quickest 
      and easiest way of generating ready-to-run JSR 168 Java portlets to connect existing 
      legacy applications and databases into an enterprise portal. When developing this 
      product Delta decided to standardize on the eXo platform for development and testing. 
      The decision was driven by comprehensive support for the JSR 168 standard, the 
      simplicity of the implementation, the runtime performance and the complete ready-to-use 
      installation.</p>

      <p><i>The Delta developers downloaded eXo from SourceForge, unpacked the installation 
        files and it ran first time. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of a number of the 
        leading commercial portal products that were tested. Delta has also decided to include 
        the eXo platform with the upcoming trialware version of SCORE Adaptive Bridges. eXo 
        platform provides a JSR 168 environment that works "out of the box", and this is what 
        Delta's customers are looking for. </i></p>

      <p><b>Music Interactive International AS</b> is developing Performing Arts Management (PAM) 
      services that provide efficient interaction between all participants in the live music 
      industry. A central piece of the company's infrastructure is the eXo platform. The PAM 
      services exploit web centric communication technologies, with mobile access, for 
      simplified processes and interactions between all the participants involved in 
      establishing a music performance. Leveraging such complex interactive services mandates 
      easy to use and standards based technology, such as the portlet standard and eXo platform.</p>

      <p>The PAM services address the whole value chain of the live music industry. The artist, 
      as the prime creator of value, builds his craft, reputation and audience through 
      performing. The PAM services link the artists with the professional intermediaries of 
      the trade, and with their audiences. The services are unique in offering solutions 
      addressing all relevant business processes.</p>

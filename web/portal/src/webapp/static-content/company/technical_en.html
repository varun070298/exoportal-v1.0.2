      <p><b>BERGLAND IT</b> is a company, looking to provide 'product-like' web solutions to their
      customers and/or resellers.</p> 
      <p><i>We are working closely with the eXo Platform team, to provide 'plug-and-play' web components that 
      offer added value to the customer, such as the Bergland Form Portlet, which will enable developers 
      to easily create rich, interactive input Forms with a minimum of effort, or the Bergland Job 
      Service and Portlets, which will enable us and our resellers to deliver high quality web applications 
      to our customers, at a minimum cost.</i></p>
      <p><i>We selected the eXo Platform because we have found, after an extensive testing period with 
      platforms from other vendors, that the eXo platform offers a very high value-to-cost ratio, combined 
      with high compatibility and openness, making it easy to use in combination with products from other 
      vendors.</i></p>
      <p><i>The quality of the individual components is excellent in itself, and the platform as a whole is 
      very well thought and balances the needs for compatibility with those for productivity in an 
      excellent way, making it more than just the sum of it's parts.</i></p> 
      <p><b><i>We were especially impressed by the design of the navigation service.</i></b></p>
      <p><i>We have found that navigation is an oft-overlooked area of portal platforms design, but not so 
      with the eXo Platform. And, apart of cost and quality, the eXo platform is Open Source, which for us, 
      was a must.</i></p>

<h3><a name="the-vision"></a>The Vision</h3>
An initiative was launched at PICA to enhance their web presence and to start
providing dynamic online services to its agents and policyholders.
Specifically, PICA wanted policyholders and agents to have the ability to
pay premiums online.

Also, they wished to provide policyholders, agents,
and internal users with the ability to generate Certificates of Insurance
(COIs).
<br><br>
When the project was initiated each PICA Group<sup>&reg;</sup> company had
it's own static site that displayed basic company and product information.
Updating the content required IT involvement to move changes to production.
PICA desired that management of the content be simplified and consolidated.
At the same time it was deemed critical to keep brand independence on each of
the separate company sites. 
<br><br>

<a href="http://www.trinisys.com" target="_blank">Trinisys</a> was hired in
August of 2004 by PICA Group, to realize this vision by developing an
enterprise portal solution. 

<h4><a name="major-goals"></a>Major Goals</h4>
The following major goals were set out for the portal initiative:
<ul>
	<li>Create three distinct sites for each of PICA's major child
		 companies.</li>
	<li>Consolidate and simplify site management.</li>
	<li>Remove IT from the content change workflow.</li>
	<li>Allow valid policyholders to self-register.</li>

	<li>Authenticate internal users against the existing Active Directory.</li>
	<li>Provide online premium payment with varying degrees of functionality
		 based on the user's role (internal users, agents, policyholders).</li>
	<li>Provide online COI generation with varying degrees of access based on
		 the user's role.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="choosing-the-portal"></a>Choosing the Portal</h3>
The following categories were used in evaluating which portal implementation
to choose:
<ul>
	<li><b>Cost</b><br>

		 The budget for this project covered the cost of developing custom portal
		 functionality, but did not allow for the purchase of a commercial portal
		 product such as Vignette or IBM Webshere Portal.</li>
	<li><b>Customizable Look-and-Feel</b><br>
		 A design for the portal was decided upon without regard to the
		 out-of-the-box appearance and navigation of portal products.  PICA
		 needed a portal product that could implement the design with as little
		 effort as possible.</li>
	<li><b>JSR 168 Compliance</b><br>
		 It was decided that custom functionality would be developed as JSR 168
		 portlets giving PICA more future flexibility.  Developing to the portlet
		 specification would free PICA from dependence on any one portal
		 implementation.
	<li><b>Security Implementation</b><br>
		 <ul>

		 	<li><u>Authentication</u> -
		 	It was determined that some custom code would need to be developed to
		 	allow external and internal users to authenticate differently. It was
		 	understood that the quality of the portal's security implementation
		 	would greatly affect the effort required to meet these
		 	requirements.</li>
		 	<li><u>Secure Transfer of Sensitive Information</u> -
			It was required that all transactions which involved sensitive user
			information take place over a secure connection (https). This would include
			logging in, registering, and all content viewed once the user
			has authenticated.</li>
		 </ul></li>
	<li><b>User-Friendly Administrative Functionality</b><br>
		 It was required that administrative tasks such as managing users and
		 updating portal content be provided through an intuitive interface.</li>

	<li><b>Portlet Catalog</b><br>
		 For the initial phases of the portal, an extensive portlet catalog was
		 not required. However, it was important that the portal provide rich 
		 out-of-the-box portlets to display, edit, and manage portal content, as
		 well as those which would provide flexible user management
		 functionality. It was also important to consider PICA's vision for
		 future portal features which would require portlets that would provide a
		 range of functionality such as forums and community message boards.</li>
	<li><b>Integration with J2EE Server of Choice</b><br>
		 It was deemed desirable (but not required) that the portal run in a
		 lightweight two-tiered environment using Tomcat.</li>
</ul>
Since low cost was one of the most important requirements, only open source
portals were considered. Some of the top contenders included Liferay,
Gridsphere, eXo Platform and Jetspeed.  Jetspeed, while a relatively mature
portal implementation, did not support the JSR 168 portlet specification and
was removed from consideration.

		Liferay to the eXo Platform.
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
-->
<br><br>

During the concept phase of the project, a high priority was placed on having
a rich porlet catalog and a simple administrative interface. For this reason
Liferay was chosen as the portal platform for the proof of concept.  As the
project matured and a final design was agreed upon it became clear that the
desired look-and-feel would not be possible to implement in Liferay without
extensive source modification.  
<br><br>
At this point the portal platform options were evaluated again. For a number
of reasons the eXo Platform was chosen. In summary:
<ul>
	<li>It was determined that the eXo Platform would be able to facilitate
		 PICA's design requirements without modifications to the portal source
		 code.</li>
	<li>The eXo Platform has an active user community making it relatively easy
		 to find discussions on and solutions to problems.</li>
	<li>The developers were easy to work with and allowed us to contribute some
		 modifications to the core eXo Platform source code.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="exo-portal-features"></a>The eXo Platform Advantage</h3>

The eXo Platform portal proved to have several advantages over its competitors,
especially where layout and configuration was concerned.  This section outlines
some of the features which make eXo Platform Portal stand out.

<h4><a name="portal-layout"></a>GUI-Enabled Web Layout</h4>
One of the most unique and powerful features of the eXo Platform is the ability
to dynamically configure the site layout using the built-in administrative
tools. Unlike other portals on the market, no jsps have to be altered to change
the layout of the eXo Platform. With eXo, all content, including the portal
navigation, is rendered by portlets.
<br><br>
For developers familiar with the Swing model of GUI development, the eXo
Platform implementation will feel very familiar. Layout in eXo is accomplished
by nested components. The main layout component is the Container.
Containers (as the name indicates) contain other layout components.
One or more portlets or containers may be encapsulated by a container.
<br><br>
Arrangement of contained elements are determined by Renderers.  Each container
specifies a Renderer which controls the layout of the container's contained
elements.  For example, if two portlets are added to a Container using the
ContainerRowRenderer the portlets will be displayed one on top of the other.
<br><br>
The image below shows the PICA site in portal edit mode. Changes made in this
mode modify the portion of the portal that remains the same regardless of
which page is being viewed. Using the controls provided, portlets and
containers can be added, removed, or shifted around in the layout.
<br><br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="center"><tr><td>
<img src="/portal/images/portal-config.jpg" border="0"><br><i>Portal Layout</i>
</td></tr></table>
<br>
Components edited while in portal edit mode represent those elements which
remain fixed from page to page. The eXo Platform takes this layout
flexibility one step further by then allowing the same level of configuration
to take place at the page level.

<br><br>
For example, in the screenshot above the page content container has a single
content portlet which is displaying the PICA welcome page. The screenshot below
shows the portal in Page Edit Mode on the Contact Us page. This page contains
two content display portlets and a custom mail form portlet.

	<i>Applying a custom skin</i>
</td></tr></table>

<h4><a name="innovative-skins"></a>Innovative Skins Implementation</h4>
The eXo platform sets itself apart from other portal implementations with its
innovative skins implementation. Simply stated, a skin controls the
look-and-feel of a given portal component, usually a portlet.
Like the eXo platform web layout implementation no portal server code needs to
be changed to alter the skin of a given component. Custom skins can be applied
to portlets as well as to any other layout component. 
<br><br>
With the eXo platform skins can be deployed to the portal as part of a custom
portlet application (.war file). This is accomplished by first creating a
cascading stylesheet (.css file) which defines the skin's look-and-feel. Then
including a skin-config.xml file that specifies to which component(s) the
stylesheet may be applied. Finally, deploy the portlet application war file to
the server. Once deployment is complete the new skins will be available
to apply to the specified layout components (shown right).
<br><br>
</td></tr></table>
The example below shows an example skin-config.xml file from the PICA Group
portal:
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="center"
		 style="margin: 10px 0px"><tr><td>
<img src="/portal/images/skin-config.gif" border="0"><br><i>skin-config.xml</i>

      &lt;style name="pica-menu" url="/pica-nav-portlets/skin/container/pica-menu-container.css"/&gt;
    &lt;/decorator&gt;
  &lt;/container-decorators&gt;

&lt;/skin-config&gt;</code></pre><i>skin-config.xml</i></div>
-->

</td></tr></table>
Three separate skins are defined.  The first is for a custom footer portlet.
The second entry is an example of a custom skin applied to an out-of-the box
eXo Platform portlet, in this case the DisplayContent portlet. And finally, the
last skin entry in this example defines a custom look-and-feel for the
ContainerRowRenderer layout component.<br><br>

skin:

		  style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;"><br>
	<i>Portal Navigation</i>
</td></tr></table>
<h4><a name="flexible-nav-tree"></a>Flexible Navigation Tree</h4>
The flexible, tree-based navigation provided by the eXo Platform proved to be
extremely useful to achieve the look-and-feel requirements of the PICA portal.
The eXo navigation tree is made up of multiple navigation nodes.
Each navigation node is associated with a specific portal page and can have
zero or more child nodes. The navigation tree can be administered with the
Navigation Menu portlet (shown right). Nodes can be added, removed, renamed,
linked to a given page, etc., using this interface.

<br><br>
The eXo Platform also provides an intuitive navigation API which makes the
process of creating customized navigation portlets quite simple.  In fact, each
of the navigation portlets shown in the portal configuration diagram above are
actually custom navigation portlets that were built by Trinisys for the PICA
portal.

<h4><a name="eclipse-plugin"></a>Eclipse Plugin</h4>
The eXo Platform Eclipse Plugin is a helpful tool for creating custom portlets.
Installing the plugin adds a 'Portlets' project type to the Eclipse IDE. 
A provided wizard walks the user through the process of creating a new 
'Portlets' project, creating all the configuration files needed for a portlets
web application. Using the plugin, portlets can be 'hot deployed' to a running
eXo portal, allowing developers to test changes quickly. It also provides a
debug mode, which allows developers to step through custom portlet code as well
as the eXo platform source code.

<h3><a name="pica-portal"></a>The PICA Group<sup>&reg;</sup> Portal</h3>

<h4><a name="portlets"></a>Portlets</h4>
For the first phase of PICA's portal, a several JSR 168 compliant portlets were
created to implement the required functionality.  The COI and Online Payment
portlets allow external and internal users perform business functions.  Other
portlets were created to alter or customize the portal beyond the out-of-the-box
functionality.  These portlets are relatively simple, and although they are JSR
168 portlets, they leverage eXo Platform services and APIs and would require
some work to port to another portal platform.

<h5><a name="coi-portlet"></a>Certificate of Insurance (COI) Portlet</h5>
The COI Portlet generates a Certificate of Insurance for a given policyholder
based on information drawn from PICA's administrative database. 
COIs are generated as PDF documents that can be viewed online, or sent to a 
requested third-party either by fax or email. Third-party recipients can
be selected from a list of entities associated with the policyholder in the
<img src="/portal/images/coi.gif" border="0" align="right"
	  style="margin: 10px 10px 0px 10px">

<!--
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" class="factoid" align="right"

</table>
-->
administrative database, or manually entered by the user. PICA's existing
RightFax solution was leveraged to provide fax transmission functionality.
Copies of all PDF files generated by the portlet are stored and viewable in
PICA's administration system for future reference. The amount of functionality
provided to the user varies by role:
<ul>
	<li><b>Internal Users</b><br>
		 Internal users are provided with a search form which allows them to
		 find policyholders by policy number, name or SSN. COIs can be 
		 generated for any policyholder matching the search criteria.</li>
	<li><b>Agents</b><br>
		 Agents also have the ability to search and generate COIs for
		 policyholders. Unlike internal users, however, agents will only be shown
		 those policies for which they are the agent.</li>
	<li><b>Policyholders</b><br>

		 Policyholders are not shown the search form and can generate COIs only
		 for their policy.</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="online-payment-portlet"></a>Online Payment Portlet</h5>
The Online Payment Portlet displays premium billing information for a policy
and allows policyholders to make payments online. PICA has a relationship with
a bank that provides the functionality to make online payments through the
bank's site. The Online Payment Portlet authenticates the current portal user
with the bank's external site and then uses content proxying to integrate the
bank's payment screens seamlessly into the portal.  Like the COI portlet, the
amount of functionality provided by the Online Payment Portlet varies by role:
<ul>
	<li><b>Internal Users</b><br>
		Internal users can view the outstanding premium balance for all policy
		holders and process payments over the phone.</li>
	<li><b>Agents</b><br>

		Agents are provided with a search form which allows them to find 
		policyholders for which they are the agent. Agents can then view their
		clients' outstanding premium balance.</li>
	<li><b>Policyholders</b><br>
		Policyholders are presented with their outstanding balance and have the
		option to pay bills online using either credit card or electronic check
		payment.</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="user-portlets"></a>User Portlets</h5>
Besides the major business functionality provided by the portlets mentioned
above, Trinisys also implemented several user management portlets to extend
or customize out-of-the-box functionality provided by the eXo Platform.
<ul>
	<li><b>Account Registration Portlet</b><br>

		 This portlet allows policyholders to register themselves with the
		 portal by providing account information which can be used to identify
		 them as valid policyholders in PICA's administrative database.  Once
		 verified the user is added to the portal user repository using the eXo
		 Organization Service API.</li>
	<li><b>Login Portlet</b><br>
		 A custom login portlet was created to fulfill PICA'S requirement to
		 use Microsoft Active Directory to authenticate internal users while
		 storing policyholder and agent users in the eXo portal database.</li>
	<li><b>User Profile Portlet</b><br>
		 This is a simple portlet that allows a user to update their display name
		 and email address.</li> 
	<li><b>Password Mailer Portlet</b><br>

		 This portlet allows external users that have forgotten their password to
		 have it mailed to their email address. If an email address was not
		 entered when creating the account, then a customer representative is
		 notified via email of the request.</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="future-portlets"></a>Future Portlets</h5>
Planned portlets include other self service type functionality to allow
policyholders to update their personal information such as contact and billing
information, request changes in coverage or payment mode, or allow
e-applications and online quoting.

<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
The eXo Platform proved to be a very flexible, cost-effective foundation upon
which to build the PICA Portal.  It allowed the seamless integration of content
and business functionality, as well as providing the flexibility required to
implement the desired look-and-feel. The PICA Group now has a solid platform
upon which they can continue to grow their web presence as future business
needs require.
